===============

This is my attempt to show what I can do with blender + WebGL + Three.js.

Welcome to Lemonlife.  You know the saying “When life throws you lemons, make lemonade.”  

The hero
You are joe or jane smoe and life sucks!!!  The life of lemons are out to get you fight them off with your weapon of wisdom.

The enemy 
Life are different lemons (lemon shapes with text on them)
- different lemons will have a text like something in life that brings us down or what we worry about.
-When we hit the lemons with the knife the lemons turn into lemonade and disappear. 


Later extensions for level ups or something.
-ambitions 
-goals
